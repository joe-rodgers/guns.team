3D Gun Printing is disrupting the states monopoly on violence and is causing disruption in the economics of violence. It's important that this information is freely available and spread wide. 

These are the resources from my [Underground Citadel](https://undergroundcitadel.com/) talk at [BitBlockBoom 2020](https://bitblockboom.com/).

### Bitcoin and 3D Printing
There's DEFINITELY overlap between the rogue gun enthusiasts, the 3D printing gang, and bitcoiners. CryptoCloaks sits in the middle of the 3D printing and Bitcoin venn diagram. They've got some cool free projects you can download and a great telegram you can follow.

### Final Thoughts
I hope you will give 3D printing a chance. You **DO NOT** have to be a mechanical engineer to get started. It is as simple as copying a file to a SD card and clicking print(yes, that is highly simplified). 

If you've read this far and still want more content, consider visiting [WORDS Bitcoin Journal](https://bitcoinwords.github.io/) or connect with me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/_joerodgers). Don't be a stranger.

Remember, you're not a real Bitcoiner unless you run a 3D Printer and always level your print bed.
